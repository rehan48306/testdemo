This project was built to demonstrate a smooth and engaging user interface using animation to enhance the user experience. My goal was to keep the UI simple, yet dynamic, focusing on micro-interactions that make the app feel more responsive and polished. I structured the components to be reusable and scalable, aiming for clean and maintainable code.

I used Framer Motion as the animation library for its ease of use, powerful features, and great React integration. It allowed me to quickly implement transitions, hover effects, and smooth entrance/exit animations.
